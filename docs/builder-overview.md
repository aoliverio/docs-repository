# Welcome in the RAD Section

In this section you can find the general information and links to specific sections, 
relating to the development of open sorce RAD solutions , as well as the necessary documentation for their use. 

The development and documentation are provided by [Antonio Oliverio](http://www.aoliverio.com), 
it is corrected and extended thanks to contributions from the community on [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aoliverio).

## What is the RAD?

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is both a general term used to refer to alternatives to the 
conventional waterfall model of software development as well as the name for James Martin's approach to rapid development.
In contrast to the waterfall model, which emphasizes rigorous specification and planning, 
RAD approaches emphasize the necessity of adjusting requirements in reaction to knowledge gained as the project progresses.
In addition to James Martin's RAD method, other approaches to rapid development include Agile methods and the spiral model. 
RAD is especially well suited (although not limited to) developing software that is driven by user interface requirements. 
Graphical user interface builders are often called rapid application development tools.

## The solution in CakePHP 3.x

**Builder** from [aoliverio/builder](https://github.com/aoliverio) on [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/aoliverio), 
it's a solution developed as CakePHP 3.x plugin, to use the best techniques and technologies, in the development of web-oriented applications.

The general features of the solution are discussed in the Builder page, 
while the extensions provided as a plug-in CakePHP environment are treated in Extensions page.
