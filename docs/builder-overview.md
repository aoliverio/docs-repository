# RAD Overview

Rapid Application Development (RAD) is both a general term used to refer to alternatives to the 
conventional waterfall model of software development as well as the name for James Martin's approach to rapid development.
In contrast to the waterfall model, which emphasizes rigorous specification and planning, 
RAD approaches emphasize the necessity of adjusting requirements in reaction to knowledge gained as the project progresses.
In addition to James Martin's RAD method, other approaches to rapid development include Agile methods and the spiral model. 
RAD is especially well suited (although not limited to) developing software that is driven by user interface requirements. 
Graphical user interface builders are often called rapid application development tools.

**Builder** from aoliverio/builder GitHub repository, is my solution, developed as a plugin in CakePHP 3.x framework, 
for the use of the best techniques and technologies, to development of web-oriented applications.
